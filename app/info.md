# Apps Folder in the Monorepo README

Welcome to the "apps" folder in our
monorepo! This is where we store all our
applications that are ready to be
shipped. In this md, we'll provide an
overview of what the "apps" folder is,
its purpose, and how to effectively
manage and work with the applications it
contains.

## What is the "apps" Folder?

The "apps" folder within our monorepo
serves as a dedicated directory where we
store all the applications developed by
our team. These applications are
typically ready for deployment, and this
folder is the staging area for managing
their source code, configurations, and
release versions. Using this approach
offers several benefits:

1. **Centralized Management**: All our
   applications are stored in one
   location, simplifying code
   management, version control, and
   deployment processes.

2. **Code Reusability**: Code sharing
   and reuse are promoted since multiple
   applications can leverage common
   libraries and components stored in
   the monorepo.

3. **Version Control**: We can maintain
   version consistency and
   synchronization across our
   applications by tracking changes in a
   single repository.

4. **Streamlined Deployment**:
   Deployments and releases are more
   straightforward when applications and
   their related resources are stored in
   one place.

## Structure of the "apps" Folder

Here's an overview of the structure of
the "apps" folder within our monorepo:

```
/
|-- apps/
|   |-- admin/          # Application 1
|   |-- extra/...          # Application 2
|   |-- mobile/...          # Application 3
|-- README.md
|-- .gitignore         # Gitignore file for specifying ignored files and folders
|-- LICENSE            # License file (if applicable)
|-- .github/           # GitHub-specific configuration (actions, workflows, templates)
```

Each subdirectory under "apps"
represents an individual application.
These subdirectories typically contain
the application's source code,
configurations, and any other resources
necessary for its functioning.



2. **Select an Application**: Navigate
   to the specific application directory
   within the "apps" folder that you
   want to work on.

3. **Development Workflow**: Follow the
   development workflow and guidelines
   provided within the application's
   README or documentation. This
   typically includes building, testing,
   and running the application.

4. **Deployment**: When you're ready to
   deploy an application, follow the
   deployment procedures defined in the
   application's documentation or refer
   to any deployment scripts provided.

5. **Contribution Guidelines**: If you
   plan to contribute to an application,
   please review its contribution
   guidelines and adhere to the
   established processes for creating
   pull requests and addressing issues.

## Additional Resources

For detailed information on each
application stored in the "apps" folder,
please refer to their respective README
files located within their individual
directories. These READMEs provide
application-specific instructions and
details.

If you have any questions, require
assistance, or encounter issues while
working with the applications in this
folder, don't hesitate to reach out to
the project maintainers or consult the
provided documentation.

Thank you for being a part of our
application development and deployment
process within the "apps" folder of our
monorepo! Together, we can deliver
high-quality software efficiently.
